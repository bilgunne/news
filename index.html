                <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he ocean is a huge body of saltwater that covers about 71 percent of Earth’s surface. The planet has one global ocean, though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans. Beginning in the 20th century, some oceanographers labeled the seas around Antarctica the Southern Ocean, and in 2021 National Geographic officially recognized this fifth ocean.</p>

                        As we said before, the ocean covers more than 71% of the Earth's surface. Beyond that, oceans are incredibly deep, meaning fish and other marine animals fill the oceans from bottom to top, from the sea floor to the water's surface. <br>

                        <br> In addition to marine animals, the sea is filled with ocean plants, which provide homes, food, and protection for sea creatures. <br>
                        
                        <br> Some of the smallest animals in the ocean are plankton. This unique species makes its home in the sunlight zone, living through a process known as photosynthesis, in which they convert light into energy. Plankton is a major source of food for many sea animals, including fish, anemones, and scallops. 
                        
                        Essentially, plankton is where life starts in the ocean.
                        
                        Let's break down some categories of ocean animals and explore them individually.<a class="nav-container-design" href="https://oceaninfo.com/animals/">see more</a></p>

                        <span><img src="img/oceanplant2.jpg" alt="ocean plants" class="text_pic"></span><br> Ocean plants have adapted to living in the marine environment and can vary from single cell organisms to thick forests of kelp. These plants are an important food source for invertebrates and fish, they provide oxygen to surrounding marine life, and they support many marine creatures by providing refuge and nursery grounds. <a class="nav-container-design" href="https://centerforsurfresearch.org/ocean-plants/">see more</a>

                <!--volcano-->
                <div>
                    <div class="ded_garchig" id="volcano">Volcano</div>
                    <p>
                        A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater. <br> 
                        
                        <br><span><img src="img/R.png" alt="volcano" class="text_pic"></span>
                        
                        For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America. <br> <br>
                        
                        <br> Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers deep in the Earth. This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.</p>

                    <p>
                        The ocean comprises a significant portion of the Earth yet it remains a field we know the least about. Humans know more about the topography of Mars than we do about the ocean floor, and our poor knowledge of seabed topography is demonstrated by the ongoing search for missing Malaysia Airline jet MH370. <br>

                        <span><img src="img/mountain.jfif" alt="mountain" class="text_pic2"></span>
                        
                        <br> Scientists and researchers, however, are trying to decrease that knowledge gap a little more. With the help of satellite technology, a team of American and European researchers recently announced that they have discovered thousands of new mountains on the ocean floor. <br>

                        <br> Up until now, there have been significant obstacles to mapping the locations of mountains on the seabed, known as seamounts. <br> 

                        <br> First of all, saltwater is opaque so that eliminates the possibility of using the same techniques used to map mountains on land. There have been other attempts to use echosounders on ships, instruments used to gather high-resolution data by bouncing sound off the sea floor. However, this method is expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, only 10% of the oceans have been surveying in this way.</p>

                    <p>
                        Several thousand marine scientists are busy at work in the United States dealing with a diversity of important issues — from climate change, declining fisheries, and eroding coastlines, to the development of new drugs from marine resources and the invention of new technologies to explore the sea. <br>

                        <br> Oceanography covers a wide range of topics, including <span><img src="img/oceanographer_vr.png" alt="oceanographer VR " class="text_pic2"></span> marine life and ecosystems, ocean circulation, plate tectonics and the geology of the seafloor, and the chemical and physical properties of the ocean. <br>
                        
                        <br> Just as there are many specialties within the medical field, there are many disciplines within oceanography. <br>
                        
                        <br> Biological oceanographers and marine biologists study plants and animals in the marine environment. They are interested in the numbers of marine organisms and how these organisms develop, relate to one another, adapt to their environment, and interact with it. To accomplish their work, they may use field observations, computer models, or laboratory and field experiments.</p>

                        The ocean plays an integral role in everything we do: from the air we breathe, to the water that we drink, to the climate and weather patterns that dictate our lives and livelihoods. Yet we have explored only 5% of the Earth's ocean water, an ocean that encompasses more than 71% of our planet. <br> 
                        
                        <br> Scientific ocean research provide the information and tools for a clearer understanding of the earth's ocean and atmosphere. Here are some outstanding global institutes and organizations doing state-of-the-art ocean research. <a class="nav-container-design" href="https://www.oceanresearchproject.org/">more...</a></p>
